            Hello world! I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina, people call me Chicho -pronounced CHEE-CHAW- and I'm loving
            this web development course so far. I work as a Software Tester and want to start coding my way to a better
            future. I have a beautiful wife and two amazing kids, and we all love to travel and explore new places.

            Argentina is a country located in the southern part of South America. It is the eighth largest country in
            the
            world by land area and the second largest in South America, after Brazil. Argentina is known for its diverse
            landscapes, which include the Andes Mountains, the Pampas grasslands, and the Iguazu Falls. The country is
            also famous for its rich cultural heritage, including tango music and dance, as well as its cuisine, which
            features dishes such as empanadas and asado (barbecue). Buenos Aires, the capital city, is a vibrant
            metropolis known for its European-style architecture, lively nightlife, and cultural attractions.
